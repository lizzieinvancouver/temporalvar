README ARCHIVED ModelRuns in temporalvar/R/archive
README started on 4 March 2018 (by Lizzie)

As of late 2017 Megan re-worked all our SLURM files to run the model longer and better. 

In this folder, I organized some of what remains from those older runs, including:

- phenmodel - really old slurm code (from early 2016)
- PhenologyModel_RC.R - old RC code from early 2016
- PhenologyModelAnalysisOLD.R â€” the analysis code from the old runs

output
- I saved only some of the RData output, you can see rollback to the older ones via commit ee1af5e265820c1953a8a4d3e9596c3ec3659e91 on 4 March 2018

graphs
- I saved all the figures I had on hand. 

ModelRuns
- This folder used to exist in the main temporalvar folder, but then we started putting model runs here, so I am putting it altogether. 
- RunHistory.csv - old file that goes through all the model runs we planned.
