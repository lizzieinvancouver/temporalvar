Oy! A place to keep track of general file craziness
For those days when git is just not enough.

Model files relating to phenologymodel_DecReset.R files:

On 11 Jan 2014 Megan pulled the 13 December code (from the end of our Hawaii meeting)named it ***phenologyModel_DecReset.R*** and started from there to work on the modeling add-ins she had been doing with an odesolver (but wasn’t quite working and I had to give a talk at ASN in Asilomar!). 

Things changed in phenologyModel_DecReset.R:
- no competition now has intraspecific competition
- so RnoC goes by species (versus just being for R)
- she added in some list structure for R, B, noC matrices so they would not be so big and unwieldy

phenologyModel_DecReset_ugh.R is similar to phenologyModel_DecReset.R — it’s a renamed version of it with some small changes. 

phenologyModel_DecReset_take2.R then includes:
- an abandonment of the lists
- added C and E and storage effect calculation attempts 
- it’s basically as far as she got

* Just as a note, lest we forget, for Lizzie’s ASN talk she [I] used the code pulled from December, as in I pulled the code from the end of the meeting and ran it. I did not use any of this reset code.
