Notes on new modeling effort
To look at priority effects ... and stuff


A few notes ...
- There is still a lot on this branch (and code within files) that we don't need for this project.


Files you will need:

In the sourcefiles folders:

getEnvt.R -- EDITED
getSpecies.R -- WORKING ON it... questions for Megan, see
#species-specific (ASK MEGAN! about the below onward ...) in getSpecies.R (but basically as of 20 July 2021, we're still mid-discussion what parameters we need. 

getOutput.R
getPlots.R 
getRunParms.R
moveOutput.R 
ResCompN.R
