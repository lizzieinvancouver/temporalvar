Met-analysis (quick one) phenological tracking

Search terms, from Kelley Slimon on 6 August 2019:

I think I have a good bunch of search terms, it gives me 176 papers and includes the paper that you linked. I combined 4 different searches:

1. Topic: 'phenolog* chang*' and Title: phenolog* AND trait*

2. Topic: 'warming shift*' AND trait* and Title: phenolog*

3. Topic: 'phenolog* track*' AND trait* and Title: phenolog*

4. Topic: 'phenolog* sensitiv*' AND trait* and Title: phenolog*

I found that making key words a necessary part of the title and more specific terms part of the topic gave me the best results. I played around with the terms 'long term' and 'climate change' but they either didn't add anything or added way too much.

Questions, from Kelley Slimon on 9 August 2019:

I've completed the initial review of my list of papers, I accepted 72 and rejected 104. I was pretty lenient with my accepting criteria and probably need to narrow it down a bit more. I have a few questions to help me do that. 

1. For the traits they measured, should I include categorical traits such as being an 'early' or 'late' flowering/nesting species, being male or female, being invasive or native etc. ?

2. Should I only accept papers that measured phenological change in response to warming - there are some that measured change in response to altered photoperiod and also rainfall. 

3. There were also traits measured that changed with induced warming or altered phenology such as specific leaf area or egg size, should I count papers that only measured these?

4. And finally, I found a few meta-analysis papers that were investigating similar things as us, could we extract data from those, or if not should I go find the papers they used to add to our list?
