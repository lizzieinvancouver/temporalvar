Yes, I should have written this sooner. This is a meta-analysis done with undergrad Kelley Slimon (KS) in 2019 to add to a paper with Megan Donahue on tracking.

We looked at correlation phenological sensitivity with traits across species (so studies needed to look at multiple species).

Most of the shared google drive (save the papers folder) is downloaded. It's https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eLDKNfLoeAXS2lkE7cq64fIoD9J7VNRF and called Tracking & Traits Meta. KS owns the folder but the three fils in it save for a folder of the papers are:

accept or reject -- google sheets that goes through all the papers meeting search criteria and whether to include them

phentrack_meta -- data extracted from papers we deemed that we should include 

Single Species Tracking -- I think this is a start on extracting data from single species studies (as a follow-up project) but that KS did not finish it.

In worked through revisions for Biological Reviews they caught the total number of papers was off by 1. In looking into (which is hard) I came to think it is off by two (2). 

Two papers marked as accept ('a') I think should be reject (though the second one you could go either way). They are:

CaraDonna_etal_2015.pdf
Carbognani_etal_2018.pdf

To deal with this I updated the file accept or reject.xlsx on Google Drive then downloaded the updated one.

One more thing I found is that a paper appearing to be unentered is just an issue with naming (there are a couple of these). It appears as first author Szilvia in the accept or reject.xlsx but as Kov√°cs2012 in the data file.
