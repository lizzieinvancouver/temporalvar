\section{Model} 
For our example, we adapt the model from Wolkovich \& Donahue 2020, which is itself an adaptation of a common model of community dynamics, often conceptualized for annual plants with a seedbank (as we do here). A more detailed description of the model can be found in Wolkovich \& Donahue 2020.

In this model, a community of \(n\) species, the seedbank ($N$) of species $i$ at time $t+1$ (where $t$ represented interannual time) is determined by the survival ($s$) of ungerminated seeds from the previous season ($1-g_{i}(t)$) plus new biomass ($B_i$) produced during the following growing season ($\delta$), which is converted to seeds at rate $\phi$:
\begin{align}
N_{i}(t+1) & =
s N_{i}(t)(1-g_{i}(t))+\phi B_{i}(t+\delta)
\end{align}
Basic $R^{*}$ competition controls new biomass each season, depending on species $i$'s resource uptake ($f(R)$ converted into biomass at rate $c_i$) minus maintenance costs ($m$), with resource uptake controlled by species-level parameters that define how the uptake increases as $R$ increases ($a$), the inverse of the maximum uptake ($u$), and the shape of the uptake ($\theta$):
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}B_i}{\mathrm{d}t} & = (c_{i}f(R) - m)B_{i} + G_{i}(t)\\ % updated (c_{i}f(R) - m)B_{i} (error in previous version)
f(R) & = \frac{a R^{\theta}}{1+a uR^{\theta}}
\end{align}
The resource ($R$) itself declines across a growing season due to uptake by all species and abiotic loss ($\epsilon$):
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} & = - \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(R)B_{i} -\epsilon R
\end{align}
Our model departs from many similar community models but explicitly modeling germination over the season ($G_{i}(t)$) by modeling more of the physiology of germination---specifically that species may delay germination beyond the start of the season (according to the resource) depending on winter conditions, including what we call `chilling.' Germination thus depends both on the traits of the species and on the environment each year. To achieve this, we modeled $G_{i}(t)$ germination as a time dependent forcing function that adds daily biomass to the ODE according to a Hill equation:
\begin{align}
G_{i}(t) & = N_{0}s_{i}b_{i}g_{i}(t)\\
g_{i}(t) & = g_{max,i}(\frac{\text{within-season-time}^{nH}}{\tau_{g50}^{nH} + \text{within-season-time}^{nH}})
\end{align}
where $b_{i}$ is the biomass per seed and where $\tau_{g50}$ is a Poisson random variable for the days of delay due to chilling, $\xi$, according to:   \\
\begin{align}
\tau_{g50} & \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\tau_{delay})\\
\tau_{delay} & = \tau_{max}e^{-\tau_{\xi}\xi}
\end{align}


ADD: While explaining the model, will need to reference (and include in figures), the plots that are made in \verb|Prieff_Species.R| to visualize. \\
% Species that are less sensitive to chilling usually start earlier and generally start at the SAME time after the start of season (resource pulse). 
% We are drawing weeks of chilling from a normal distribution and that distribution is always the same. 

\noindent \emph{Simulations:}\\
Given an overview of simulations performed, be sure to mention: two-species communities, species vary in \emph{what} and explain a little what that does (for example: We varied species' resource use efficiency (\emph{via} $c_i$), yielding species with different $R^*$ (a metric of resource competition where a lower $R^*$ means a species can draw the resource down to a lower level and is thus considered the superior competitor)) and then state something like ``All other parameters were identical between species (Table \ref{tab:model})." Also need: starting conditions (for example: both species were initialized with a census size of $N(0) = 100$ per unit area, and the temporally varying parameters $R_0(t)$ and $\tau_{p}(t)$ were generated) and then some re-wording of this:
\begin{quote}
Within-year $R^{*}$ competition dynamics were solved using an ode solver (\verb|ode| in the R package \verb|deSolve|) and ended when the resource was drawn down to $min(R^{*})$, i.e. the $R^{*}$ value of the better resource competitor.  The end-of-season biomass of each species was converted to seeds, and the populations were censused.  At each census, a minimum cutoff was applied to define extinction from the model.  Note that `coexistence' in this model is defined by joint persistence through time and not by low density growth rate.
