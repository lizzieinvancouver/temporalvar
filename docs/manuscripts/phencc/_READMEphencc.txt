April 2021 

Ideally in this order ...

(1) Work on the future directions section, there some % text/ideas to try to work in neatly
(2) Re-read and fix/clean up the whole thing
(3) Work on the letter (though can chip away at sooner, if feeling a little brain dead this week)

10 Feb 2021 -- from Alison

My basic understanding of the concept is: phenological tracking has two components one related to fitness and the other to ensure growth occurs under optimal environmental conditions, and there are trade-offs. This is further complicated by competition within a community and even further complicated by climate change which can result in a stationary environment transitioning to a non- stationary environment. Understanding how these factors interact is complex but necessary to develop reliable models of community structure as climate warms.

Overall, I think this is an important area of research and the review is timely -- my suggestions would be to present the purpose/aims of the review, provide clear and succinct definitions of stationary vs non- stationary and the different trackings, and refocus the conclusions. A short sec<on on recommendations including what ecological and climate data would be necessary to ensure meaningful projections of future community assemblies.

Why is this review imp: If you think just in a single species context you will not understand the outcomes because we know both abiotic and BIOTIC forces shape species and communities. Also, changing joint distributions of the environment and thinking about that more comprehensively and thinking about how that will change structured of communities.

Some maybe (or maybe not) helpful notes

HilleRisLambers 2012
"By community assembly, we mean the process by which species from a regional pool colonize and interact to form local communities."

"From the 1970s through the 1980s, studies on community assembly primarily asked whether competitive interactions between species generated predictable patterns of species co-occurrence in communities..."

"Our goal with this review is therefore to explore empirical studies relevant to community assembly through the lens of contemporary coexistence theory, and by doing so, identify important ways forward. We do so in three steps ..."


Chesson & Huntly 1997
Harsh conditions reduce population growth and may reduce intensity of interactions between species ... but they don't reduce the importance of ecological interactions. .. "Species coexistence requires niche differences."

"... effects of environmental fluctuations depend on particular ecological circumstances"

'Environmental fluctuations provide opportunities for temporal niche partitioning but do not fundamentally change the impact of interspecific competition.
