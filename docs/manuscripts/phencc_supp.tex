\section{Literature review}
We systematically reviewed the literature for studies examining tracking and other traits. We searched ISI in August 2019 for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Topic: `phenolog* chang*' and Title: phenolog* AND trait*
\item Topic: `warming shift*' AND trait* and Title: phenolog*
\item Topic: `phenolog* track*' AND trait* and Title: phenolog*
\item Topic: `phenolog* sensitiv*' AND trait* and Title: phenolog*
\end{enumerate}
which resulted in 231 papers. From here we used the following criteria to determine from which papers we could not extract data: no phenology or phenological change measured (72 papers), no trait(s) measured or analyzed (48 papers), single-species studies focused on intra-specific variation (54 papers), modeling or theory studies without data (12 papers), or papers without new data presented (reviews, etc.: 4 papers), or miscellaneous reasons (1 paper measured a phenological response to grazing). This left us with only 27 papers including relevant data, seven of which did not test for a relationship between tracking and the other studied traits. We present data from the remaining papers in Tables \ref{tab:meta1}-\ref{tab:meta2}. Most studies examined tracking as how a phenophase related to temperature (89\% of all tracking metrics), followed by precipitation (9\%), followed by the climate mode NAO.  

% Need to add why my review was not included (no tracking) and not including Brown review ... 
% Should add average number of traits and phenophases in each study.
