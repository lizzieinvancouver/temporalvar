\section{Literature review}
We systematically reviewed the literature for studies examining tracking and other traits. We searched ISI in August 2019 for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Topic: `phenolog* chang*' and Title: phenolog* AND trait*
\item Topic: `warming shift*' AND trait* and Title: phenolog*
\item Topic: `phenolog* track*' AND trait* and Title: phenolog*
\item Topic: `phenolog* sensitiv*' AND trait* and Title: phenolog*
\end{enumerate}
which resulted in 176 papers. From here we used the following criteria to determine from which papers we could not extract data: no phenology or phenological change measured (58 papers), no trait(s) measured or analyzed (44 papers), single-species studies focused on intra-specific variation (32 papers), modeling or theory studies without data (8 papers), or papers without new data presented (reviews, etc.: 4 papers), or miscellaneous reasons (1 paper measured a phenological response to grazing, while another ... XX). This left us with only 27 papers including relevant data. 

% Need to add why my review was not included (no tracking) and not including Brown review ...
