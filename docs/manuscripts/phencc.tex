\section{Outline}
So, there's a pretty basic structure to what we want to walk through:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In \emph{stationary environments} ...
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe R* and how species with lower R* always wins (intra-annual dynamics generally) ... need other axis of competition for coexistence
\item Moving onto interannual variation: in temporally variable environments species with $\tau_i$ closer to averae $\tau_{P}$ should always win
\item For variation in $\tau_i$ to exist, need other axis of coexistence (such as R*)
\item But what if $\tau_i$ is not a fixed species attribute? Introduce tracking...
\item Then speices with higher $\alpha$ should win
\item Unless you have another axis of coexistence (such as R* or $\tau_i$)
\end{enumerate}
\item In \emph{nonstationary environments} ... (need some help with phrasing)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Earlier $\tau_i$ is favored more (R* versus $\tau_i$ runs: previously these coexisted via a higher R* and less ideal $\tau_i$)
\item Tracking is favored more ... or effective $\tau_i$ is really favored more ($\tau_i$ vs. $\alpha$ runs)
\item Tracking is favored more ($\alpha$ versus R*)
\end{enumerate}
\item But this all assumes that nonstationarity happens on only one dimension of the environment; just like species niches, the environment is multidimensional and nonstationarity in it may be multidimensional also. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show what happens when R0 get smallers as $\tau_{P}$ gets earlier
\end{enumerate}
\item And, we conclude.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Phenology \& climate change paper} ...  below is from \verb|VarEnv_notes|\\
\noindent Possible titles: `Phenological tracking: It's more complicated than you think' (we hope) or `Phenological tracking: Is it naive?'
\begin{enumerate}
\item Opening
\begin{enumerate}
\item Communities shifting due to climate change (species increasing and decreasing)
\item Phenology has been implicated in driving this 
\item The theory goes that as seasons get earlier, earlier species win out over later species (don't get into tracking yet)
\item Yet no one to date has ever examined whether this hypothesis is supported through community coexistence theory and models
\item So here we provide the first test using a model that explicitly considers how within and between year dynamics can drive coexistence
\end{enumerate}
\item Under this model climate change critically alters the environment in a couple ways
\begin{enumerate}
\item Climate change...
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\tau_{P}$ gets earlier (i.e., start of season gets earlier)
\item $R_{0} \downarrow$ (e.g., in systems started by a pulse of water from snowpack)
\item $var(R_{0}) \uparrow$ 
\item $\epsilon \uparrow$ (i.e., it gets hotter and resources like water evaporate quicker)
\end{enumerate}
\item Of these, changes in $\tau_{P}$ are aguably the most observed and should be most important to impacts on coexistence via phenology thus we focus on how shifts in $\tau_{P}$ impact coexistence.
\item We first examine the role of phenology in a stationary environment ... then to X, Y, Z.
\end{enumerate}
\item Under a stationary environment what trade-off is required with tracking to allow coexistence?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two species ($i, j$) case
\begin{enumerate}
\item Vary $\tau_P$ by drawing from a stationary distribution and let $R^*$ and $\alpha$ also vary by being drawn from each of their own (non-joint) distributions, run a bunch of models of 2 species communities and extract co-existing ones. 
\item Plot $\frac{\alpha_i}{\alpha_j}$ (or, perhaps better: realized proximity to $\tau_P$) by  $\frac{R^{*}_{i}}{R^{*}_{j}}$ for coexisting pairs of species (PhenTrackFig. 1, not currently shown here, see paper notes) -- we expect a cloud of space where coexistence is possible.
\end{enumerate}
\item Multi-species case
\begin{enumerate}
\item (Similar to above) Vary $\tau_P$ by drawing from a stationary distribution and let $R^*$ and $\alpha$ also vary by being drawn from each of their own (non-joint) distributions for a $n>2$ set of species, and pull out coexisting species from each run. 
\item Plot $\alpha$ (or realized proximity to $\tau_P$) against $R^*$ for each community of coexisting species (PhenTrackFig. 2, not currently shown here, see paper notes), measure the correlation and the noise around it.
\item Examine the distribution of correlations (and maybe noise) for all communities (PhenTrackFig. 3, not currently shown here, see paper notes).
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Under a non-stationary environment of earlier $\tau_P$ how: (1) does this trade-off change and (2) do communities change?\footnote{Megan may have better notes on this section}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two species case: take the coexisting 2-species communities from part I and add nonstationarity in $\tau_P$ and ...
\begin{enumerate}
\item see how long it takes to lose one species. 
\item see which ones persist longest and mark on PhenTrackFig. 1 (e.g., re-do PhenTrackFig. 1 with bubble plots or such for how long the two species persist together).
\end{enumerate}
\item Multi-species case: take the coexisting multi-species communities from part I and add nonstationarity in $\tau_P$ and ...
\begin{enumerate}
\item stop at $X$ timepoint and re-do PhenTrackFig. 2 and 3 to see how they have shiften (e.g., you may lose the middle species --- those that are not the best competitors nor the best trackers ...).
\item extract timepoints when 10\% and/or 50\% of species are lost. 
\item extract when each species is lost in a community and order the species loss of PhenTrackFig. 2.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Are there environmental conditions under which tracking won't work as a strategy? (This is the section where we return to $R_{0}$ and $\epsilon$, which we just mentioned earlier.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Thinking about environmental correlations (e.g., spring gets earlier and drier or such), are there some where tracking will not be favored?
\item Answer: Yes, probably whenever you shift the environment in another way (in addition to earlier $\tau_P$) that does not impact the competitive dominant but does negatively impact the competitve inferior/tracker (See also Figure 1 below). 
\item So, for example if $\tau_P$ gets earlier \emph{and} $R_0$ gets smaller then the trackers may decline.  
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Figures}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Real-world data showing stat/non-stationarity in environment (ideally $\tau_{P}$) 
\item Real-world data showing tracking (and less tracking)
\item $\tau_{P}$ vs. R* trade-off and histogram of persisting $\tau_i$ under stat/nonstat $\tau_{P}$ environment
\item alpha vs.$\tau_i$ trade-off and histogram of persisting alpha under stat/nonstat $\tau_{P}$ environment
\item alpha vs. R* trade-off and histogram of persisting alpha under stat/nonstat $\tau_{P}$ environment
\item time-series of one run showing years where $\tau_i$ of one species is close to $\tau_{P}$ and other years where $\tau_i$ of other species is close to $\tau_{P}$ (and show this shift under nonstat)
\item non-stationarity in $R0$ and $\tau_{P}$
