Notes from skyping with Megan 
4 February 2015
About her scanned notes.
+++ separate my notes I wrote on each of her pages ….

Notes from Page 1:
Page 1 and page 5 go together.
- depending on how you define d it can vary from yr to yr or not (this is explored on pg 5).
- pg 1 reflects how G&L and did death (but you end up with a fraction that varies yr to yr, although E and C fall out easily — see pg 1)

++++
Page 2 is a discussion of C being proportional between species (she’s not yet sure how important this is to us).
Right now she thinks we can do this without making this assumption.

Calculations of mid-page 2 depend on pg 1 and thus are not correct. Put 1st line of relative recruitment in and note that we need to redo for our E, C

++++
pg 3-4 do the calculation of Table 1 from Chesson 2003 done up so we can code them!

<> mean expectations
v means variance (not e for expectation, e is the environment!)

check her math!
It’s mainly algebra …

Page 4: 
storage effect on top,
relative nonlinearity at bottom of this page

++++
Page 5 (left, towards bottom) This is our E and C! 

Page 5 cont:
The sidebars are pre or post season counts. She stuck with pre-season count.
- i is usually invader,  j is usually species index, l is supplementary index (e.g., the other species).
- so does not follow G&L (hopefully she was consistent)
