23 Sept 2015: tauI issues

OK, I think I can clarify.
tauI is used in getSpecies.R,  line 16

g <- gmax*exp(-h*(matrix(rep(tauP,nsp),nrow=length(tauP),ncol=nsp)-matrix(rep(tauI,nyrs),ncol=nsp,nrow=nyrs,2))^2)

This defines the germination fraction in each year.  It creates a yrs x spp matrix of the difference between year t tauP and species specific tauI 

….

Actually, I'm not sure what you are using as the primary file at this point.

There is also a file PhenologyModel_Simple.r

In that file, g is defined in line 53 in the same way as it is defined in getSpecies.R

If you are using a version of PhenologyModel.r, then the source call to getSpecies.R defines the variable g and g itself is called in line 80.

20 August 2015: Skype with Megan

Peter’s talk at ESA:
- Takes Beverton-Holt model (which you can write in closed form), divides into two chunks, one goes to infinity was t approaches zero (and it depends on initial conditions) and the other is the long-term equilibrium (intrinsic dynamics).
- Most of his models do not allow to solve for equilibrium (but they allow you to solve for coexistence). 
- He said you could say equilibrium is if the community tracks the environment (but that doesn’t work about the lottery model so he does not like that).
- So he says that equilibrium stuff is okay even with a non stationary environment.
- She suspects he will ‘don’t worry about equilibrium, it’s approximately in equilibrium.’


From Dynamic Ecology blog (Jeremy Fox’s blogged impressions of ESA):
I’ve been expecting and hoping for this for a couple of years, and this is the year it finally happened: modern coexistence theory, as developed by Peter Chesson and collaborators, is going mainstream. I’ll even go out on a limb and predict that it’s the next big thing in community ecology. Deborah Goldberg stood up in front of a huge Ignite session crowd and named it as one of the two most important ideas in community ecology right now. A number of people besides the usual suspects gave talks on it, including about how to apply it to new problems. Steve Ellner has invented a new statistical approach that should make estimates of the temporal storage effect (a particularly important component of modern coexistence theory) both easier to do and more accurate. And Peter Chesson presented what may be a major extension of the theory.

17 June 2015: Skype with Megan

Two possible issues with coexistence equations:

(1) 2003 TPB paper assumes competition can be measured at the community level (so all species have same C, for example they all compete equally for water) — which is okay, but not what we’re doing (rephrased, from Megan’s email on 11 Jun 2015: I have identified a potential source of the discrepancy in our storage effect and relative nonlinearity calcs (essentially, the coexist equations I have been using assume that competition is the same for all species, but our calcs assume species specific C), so I am trying to resolve that.  I'm not sure where things are at on your end and what would be most helpful right now wrt your proposal.
… 1994 TPB assumptions help understand the 2003 TPB paper.
… seed model from Oecologia paper is in section 5.5 of 1993 paper.
(2) “Time-varying death is unfortunate” — Dealing with death varying by time — this is related to issue of germination being part of dying (and all her counting seeds work)


We discussed when to next meet-up:
	- She suggested probably first week of August (so she can go to ESA after)
	- Then we meet in fall/winter (probably January)
		- In Hawaii 	
		- Or at Whiteley Center?
		- Or before/after Asilomar (10-14 Jan)

Note many things below (25 May) we did not get to!

***************
25 May 2015: Still some to dos here!!!

To do next on PhenologyModel_SimpleTRY.R:
	(1) Add to the bottom of the loop writing output for coexist dataframe (I need to better understand from Megan how the output works, I think we get each one for each species?
	(2) Do we need modelparams df? Guess it’s fine to have for now

So 5 dataframes in the end:
		(1) sppabundances: each col gives abundance (averaged over last 5 timesteps of model) for one species, each row is a run
		(2) tauI: each col gives tauI for one species, each row is a run
		(3) alpha: matrix of alphas, third dimension is the run number
		(4) modelparams: params that should not vary from run to run (nsp, p, q, etc.)
		(5) coexsit: relnonlin, meanFit and storage effect (each a column) for each run (run is in the row)

From email with Megan/plus added thoughts:

I thought on needs for the CAREER award I need to write soon and I think I need:
    (a) equations, all very correct
    (b) some output under a stationary and non-stationary scenario - ideal to show shifting relevance of storage effect versus other coexistence mechanisms but also showing differing time-series dynamics for small community (1 figure) and favoring of different tauI (second fig) would work
    (c) I could also use your help trying to brainstorm how to combine the two portions of my grant (testing for niche/neutrality in Gothic data and this project) better.
    (d*) (Did NOT include in email) some phenological tracking output? Maybe? *this seemed doable two weeks ago when I wrote and now seems unnecessary, but I guess we could add it easily and perhaps a simple graph showing tauP on the X axis and tauI on the Y axis of a tracking and non-tracking species could be interesting.... I think we can definitively table this until I get a draft of the grant going.



* ASK MEGAN! * Do alphas only range 0-1 or can they be -1 to 1?
* ASK MEGAN! See (1) above about the coexistence stuff


***************

28 April 2015:

** Slowly working on my code tasks! **
What I need …
	- to vary: tau_i, alpha_ii, alpha_ij (latter two are intra and interspecific competition)
	- to keep from each param run:
	(1) population of each species at the end (or average of last couple years, eventually some true coexistence solution like long-term growth rate or such?) — MAKE THIS one matrix!
	(2) coexistence values (storage effect, rel. nonlinearity etc.)
	(3) full params of run
	(*) So maybe make 2+3 one dataframe and include abundance of 1st species to check other matrix?


4 February 2015:

** Talk with Megan **
- I email RC…..


January 29 2015:

** Talk with Megan AM:
- Calculating E, C is easier with LV because:
(1) There is no resource draw down throughout the season
(2) Convert numbers to biomass and then back again
- Beyond that, Peter tends to lays out empirical cases where C is not species-specific, so that all the alphaIs are the same: all the intraspecific and interspecific competition is equal
- When you do that your niche overlap is complete so all coexistence is due to the storage effect
- A good place to start, Megan thinks but someday (I said) we have to let them covary with tauI

- Megan is working on storage effect and mean fitness differences …

** Talk with Megan PM:

- RC?!
- I do latex work once I receive scanned docs
- s is constant, sg is not
- goal: get to where she can ask if I find coexistence with param ranges she says should coexist!
- check-in around 6pm EST? Otherwise before middle of next week!


++++++++++++++++++
January 28 2015:

** Misc notes:
- When to show Megan my job talk?
- In BromusEarly, the natives win every so often, but everything seems dead at the end


** Talk with Megan AM:
- How do Godoy & Levine model germination timing? They don’t, they just have the different densities of planting.
- What we want to do is find alphas that would NOT predict coexistence but where tauI and temporal variation do allow coexistence.
- We also need to *calculate the storage effect.* To do that we need to find an average competitive effect on the focal species. 
- We still need to be able to calculate coexistence internally, no? Rank species? How to determine long-term coexistence?
	- Megan says we can do this by getting the long-term low-density growth rate (good)
	- say they coexist for X number of years (a less good approach)

* I will work on:
- going through the parameter space
- I will set lambda, s, and intraspecific competition as static
- vary interspecific competition, and g
- then calculate:
(1) persistence
(2) A.16 from Godoy & Levine based on long-run average of g
(3) rho
(4) fitness rations (k/k)

* Megan will work on:
- How to calculate the storage effect.
- How to calculate the long-term low density growth rate.


++++++++++++++++++
January 27 2015:


** Talk with Megan: Morning: 
- Look at Godoy appendix
- Look at empirical papers: TPB 2003 paper, or Chesson 2008 book chapter could work or Sears & Chesson paper
- Copula follow-up: just generate multivariate normal (function in R) with correlations to link tauI and ci (or whatever we decided). Marginal distribution of each one is normal so together you get a multivariate normal: it should take the mean and var of each, plus the correlation!
- Goal for later chat: tasks for Lizzie

** Talk with Megan later: 6pm my time:

- empirical work: we would run model with and without competition and then use those methods

* Megan’s quandary: all of Peter’s work assume heterospecific intxns are of equal magnitude; she thinks this means you end up assuming no
- also in Godoy & Levine they have alphas based on ‘community’ — no different ones for each species
- sort of akin to assuming diffuse competition, which is okay

* my task tomorrow!
- simplify our code so within-yr dynamics follow LV model
- no need for odesolve
- see second half of eqn A.6 in Godoy & Levine supp

January 26 2015:

Talked to Megan about:
- NSF reviews
- Kraft/Godoy papers

Godoy paper:
- reminds Megan we should think about an empirical approach to estimating fecundity in absence of and with competition (versus looking for neat solution to E, C I believe)
- appears to have no correlation with variance but Megan will look into this.
- only one year of dynamics but they vary space for time: by adjusting the germination densities they can look at a variety of population dynamics in one year.
- essentially they use Lotka-Volterra (LV) instead of R*

NSF reviews:
- Megan thought they were long, impressive; I was still grumpy about them
- we will NOT get analytical solutions for nonstationary storage effect model 
- will not be a general solution (even though *maybe* one is possible) — this will be unsatisfying to some — but a lot to still be gained by it
- should be upfront about the above; could mention Peter appears to be working on this (maybe cite an ESA abstract?)
- our model does vary gemination, we should make this clear — also Peter makes some comments about things like germination versus fecundity and what is most likely to lead to a storage effect, we should look at these

End thoughts:
- try simpler within-yr competition model? 
	- it would preclude nonlinearity and we would lose evapotranspiration (could still model as a stress on some species parameters though)
	- if we did LV, we would have germination be the same and still have pulse
- try empirical approach to calculating E, C?

Thoughts:
- where the blabbidy are all my notes?
- I just have this note in my to do:
- thinking of ways to represent each species biomass in and out each season (and how to break code when R=R*)


++++++++++++++++++
Chat with Megan on 25 August 2014

- Last version did not coexist, she is trying to figure out why
- she got them to coexist by extending dates and decreasing extinction threshold (see getRunParms.R)
- we also don’t know how Peter converted from biomass to seed
- [note that we both think we had this running and matching Peter’s work way back when]


++++++++++++++++++

To do from 20 November 2013
    
- work on the outside loop to collate multiple runs of the model
a couple notes on this:
+ do a list of lists (each run gets 1 list probably with 2 pieces)
+ save the constants in one vector or such
+ save the time-varying parameters (R, taus etc.) in a dataframe that also includes the peak biomass for each species, and final resource for each year (years going by row)
+ include the seed somewhere perhaps

- set up an issue tracker/to-do site for Megan and I?



Megan will:
- check Otto notes
- work on measuring storage effect in model (!!!)
- add in tracking of tau i or work on it some

emails:

5 Nov 2013 (from Megan):

Hi Lizzie,
    I need to migrate from working at home to the office. 
Here's what I have done so far:

    * Extended the code nsp species
    * Generalized parameter calls, although left all as constants except tau_i
    * Changed the abundance plot to generalize to nsp (made a loop with your plot)
    * Applied a cutoff for extinction ( I.e., when biomass falls below cutoff, then really a zero):
          o In Peter's model, the biomass arising from the germination inf a single seedling is given a unit of 1.  And initial population sizes are 10.  So, I am going to assume this is a per area measure.  E.g., per meter squared.  So, if the population declined to less than 1 per hectare, perhaps we call that extinct.
    * My initial look at the tau_i's of those coexisting made me think that early season is better, and then early and late together are ok, but ones in the middle don't persist
    * To look at this, I want to (but haven't yet) plot the theoretical distribution of tauP (i.e., dbeta(p,q)), the stochastic values of tauP over the simulation, and then the tauI values for coexisting species (in one color) and for the exticnt species (in a second color)
    * Lastly, we need to think about how to structure the code to scale to our next task: save out the coexisting communities, so we can shift the envt and see who wins
    * Note that we still have not invoked a tradeoff.  Instead, we have made all species equal except for timing of germination

How best to do a bunch of runs and pull 


Some literature notes:
- Mathias & Chesson 2013 (TPB) is about within year coexistence from temporally-varying environments, but they specifically add environmental weather variation within year to do it, which is different than what we do (and it's a lot about speciation).
