- Megadroughts (see megadroughts.txt for notes)

- For our main project
		- Diffs between runs (see modelrun_notes.csv) and why coexistence is low
		- Some runs are drifting to extinctions. See interannual folder, what to do?

(1) Surfing lessons
(2) Megadroughts
(3) the model runs ... more on this below. 

The nonstationary runs are so COOL!

3651135236511384 are very similar, and have abysmally low coexistence (15/5000), should we do more runs? My notes (from chatting with Megan say that only diff is 500/500 stat/ns and then 1000/500).

366919543669195536691956 are all very similar runs, but I think we picked dynamics where there is no chance of coexistence even over the first several hundred years (see interannual plots) so we need to rethink these runs.

Check out modelruns_notes.csv, for:
	36511349 -- Tables of RunParms says TauI does not vary (but I think it does)
	36691943 -- My results disagree with Table of RunParms!
	I have a different guess on model dynamics than TableRunParms suggests.


Things to think about:
	- Do we want to further define our definition of coexistence to things that look more stable? 

Next steps, what to prioritize?
	- Getting all the Bout runs going.
	- Making the code nicer.
	- Other plots that we want?
