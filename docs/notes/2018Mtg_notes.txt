- Megadroughts (see megadroughts.txt for notes)

- For our main project
		- Diffs between runs (see modelrun_notes.csv) and why coexistence is low
		- Some runs are drifting to extinctions. See interannual folder, what to do?

- Things to think about:
	- Do we want to further define our definition of coexistence to things that look more stable?
