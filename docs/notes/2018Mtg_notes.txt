- Megadroughts (see megadroughts.txt for notes)

- For our main project
		- Diffs between runs (see modelrun_notes.csv) and why coexistence is low
		- Some runs are drifting to extinctions. See interannual folder, what to do?

(1) Note: Coexistence is positive growth from low-density. We should (probably) focus on persistence. 
(2) the model runs ... more on this below. 

The nonstationary runs are so COOL!

3651135236511384 are very similar, and have abysmally low coexistence (15/5000), should we do more runs? My notes (from chatting with Megan say that only diff is 500/500 stat/ns and then 1000/500).

366919543669195536691956 are all very similar runs, but I think we picked dynamics where there is no chance of coexistence even over the first several hundred years (see interannual plots) so we need to rethink these runs.
-> We will switch to diffs in c of 1 or less.


Understanding Tables of RunParms:
VarRStar1
- If VarRStar1 and VarRStar2 are the numbers then those are the values
- If VarRStar1=0, then Star same for both app but varies between runs
- If VarStar=1 and VarStar=NA then each is drawn is varies


Things to think about:
	- Do we want to further define our definition of coexistence to things that look more stable? 

Next steps, what to prioritize?
	- get coexistence for the nonstationary runs at the end of the stationary period (how many make it?)
	- Getting all the Bout runs going.
	- Making the code nicer.
	- Other plots that we want?

How to pull out whether the better tracker wins in the nonstationary runs?
