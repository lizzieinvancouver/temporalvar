Parameter & Definition & Reality notes \\ \hline

\begin{tabular}{ | p{3.0cm} | p{6.0cm} | p{4.0cm} |}
\(N_{i}\) & seedbank of species \(i\) & data possible, sure (RCN with Elsa?) \\ \hline
\(s_{i}\) & survival of species \(i\) & data possible, sure \\ \hline
\(\delta\) & total length of growing season & yes! I have those data\\ \hline
\(B_{i}\) & biomass of species \(i\) & yes \\ \hline
\(R\) & resource & blargg, no?\\ \hline
\(c_{i}\) & conversion of \(R\) uptake to biomass of species \(i\) &  someone has something like this \\ \hline
\(m_{i}\) & maintenance costs of species \(i\) & someone has something like this \\ \hline
\(a_{i}\) & uptake increase as \(R\) increases for species \(i\) & someone has something like this, maybe\\ \hline
\(u_{i}\) & max uptake for species \(i\) & someone has something like this, maybe \\ \hline
\(\phi_{i}\) & converesion of biomass to seedbank for species, includes overwintering of seeds \(i\) & this is totally weird, must ask Megan \\ \hline
\(\epsilon\) & abiotic loss of \(R\) & hmm, could look at water draw down curves? Would not be the same thing ... \\ \hline
\(g_{max,i}\) & max germination of species \(i\) & data possible \\ \hline
\(h_{i}\) &  controls the the rate at which germination declines as \(\tau_{p}\) deviates from optimum for species \(i\)  & I think this is possible \\ \hline
\(g_{i}\) & germination fraction & yes, someone has these \\ \hline
\(\tau_{p}\) & timing of pulse & well, I have data on SOS \\ \hline
\(\tau_{i}\) & timing of max germination of species \(i\) & uh, I don't think anyone on earth has these ...\\ \hline
\(\alpha_{i}\) & phenological tracking of species \(i\) & I have these data! \\ \hline
\(\theta_{i}\) & shape of uptake for species \(i\) & sure, someone has these\\ \hline
\hline
\(b_{i}\) & seedling biomass of species \(i\) & uh, ask Megan \\ \hline
\(f_{i}(R)\) & \(R\) uptake \(f(x)\) for species \(i\) & NA -- only a conglomeration of other params\\ \hline
\(d_{i}\) & death rate of species \(i\), used in calculations of lifespan & uh, ask Megan \\ \hline
\(T\) & between year time & years \\ \hline
\(\tau\) & within season time & days \\ \hline

\newpage
\noindent \emph{Thoughts, Friday-style:}\\

\noindent There are basically 5 categories for these variables:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Resource uptake f(x)s which exist somewhere for a bunch of species for exactly the model stuff here I suspect: R*
\item Germination curves: Different folks have these data; Margie Mayfield approached me about starting a group to pull such data together; Elsa knows someone with some data like these---we were discussing running an RCN together.
\item Parameters I don't quite get or suspect are impossible to measure: \(d_{i}\) , \(b_{i}\), \(\phi_{i}\) 
\item Data I actually have: related all to start of season and phenologically-tracking. I should note that I have the {\bf biological} start of season (SOS), not a climatic one (if we wanted that we could work with Ben Cook to get it though); and also I have weird data because I have ground-collected data. Some might argue satellites would be better for SOS because there is no bias in species studied etc. -- but then you argue back that I might have the little baby species that actually start the seasons, not the green wave.
\item Stuff not on the list here that I think were interested in: namely, what changes with climate change and how much! Must add that to the list!
\end{enumerate}
