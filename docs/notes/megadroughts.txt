- I was trying to remember why we switched to messing with phi instead of something related to the shape of the germination curves ... after some discussion I believe the answer is:
	- Just having differently shaped germination curves will never lead to exotic extinction, because our current model always produces some biomass and thus some seeds if *any* seed germinates. We could change the model to where being super mismatched in someway does lead to failure (or a super low biomass lead to complete failure) but that would be a new model formulation and thus perhaps a bit of a pain.
	- Changing phi changes a more well-known, well understood parameter and works perhaps better with the literature. 
	- All the data we have (on California exotics) show how much higher phi is for exotics compared to natives.

- Things to look:
	- persistence of each species type under current vs. mega drought conditions
	- what climate drives extinctions in megadroughts
	- how realistic is the trade-off needed for extinction?

- vary: phi and s under three scenarios (which we expect will help us find the sweet spot where things go extinct quickly):
(1) tauI=taup
(2) tauI is 1sd from tauI
(3) tauI is 2sd from tauI


- Are phi and s what we really want to vary or are they effectively one variable and thus cannot trade-off?
-> What we really think happens is that exotics cannot survive years with extremely low seedset (because of low survival) but native species can, thus should we be adding a failure threshold (where below some biomass a plant produces 0 seeds).

- We probably cannot get true coexistence in this model without identical species (we think this is a lottery model which leads to one species) but that's okay! Because we think this is all transient dynamics: in the previous state (megadroughts) the natives should win, in the current state the exotics should win (and the natives are going slowly extinct) ... or you could say the long-term winner is the natives and the exotics are effectively occupying a transient niche.

- Ben sent the megadrought runs, yay! Now what? 

- What are axes of coexistence trade-off (coexistence, aka persistence)?
- Axes of coexistence in wet year runs: seed bank survivorship, conversion of biomass to seeds (we also discussed differences in Rstar: natives have slower resource uptake but draw down resources lower, while exotics have quicker uptake but cannot draw down resources lower). This is the lottery model (which is death rate and larvae produced), which only works with overlapping generations. So we should vary something else … we discussed also vary tauI (but same for both species: this will be harsher on the short-lived species), but should we make the distance between tauI and tauP constant across runs (leading to overall fitness that is constant across the environment)?

- Interesting point by Megan: if the natives are better at tracking the TRUE pulse, are they they better trackers then? 

- To start: find species pairs with trade-off between seed survivorship and biomass-to-seed conversion efficiency (don’t vary Rstar … yet)

- Think of Grime triangle: ruderal, stress tolerant, competitive … we’re working to start on two corners.

- We have established variation in the environment (Ben sent us that), we have to look just at the variation in our model parameters. 

So, here are our questions!
- Question 1: How big a survivorship difference is needed to lead to exotic extinction in exotic species?

- Question 2: How robust is this difference (e.g., if you add in competition differences or you vary tracking)?

- TemporalVar project
- Cat’s regional risk stuff

- Step 1: Rescale the drought index to our mu, sigma for R
- Step 2: 
	option a) use the time series to drive the model (a megadrought one and an old one)
	option b) use additional realizations that sample the same statistical space (pull out the last 200 yrs and a 200 yrs megadrought period)

Phase randomization: convert ts into phase space, randomizes it, and puts it back together into ts space, you’re limited by the ts length you put in so he would do it twice and stitch them together. 

How many do we want? 10K?

Next steps:
- send him a mu and sigma (and distribution that we want) and any practical upper and lower bounds (based on our model)
- he’ll send this to us end of next week and we’ll do the runs!
- he can also send a future climate angle!  (Since we expect the return of the megadroughts!) 

Other thoughts:
- Any paleo ecological data on what happened to the native species in the last megadrought?

- Run the same set of species parameters on megadrought and not-megadrought (paired runs)
- Bound below by 0, above by 4.5 (we’ve been using lognormal(log2, 0.2) but we’re not wedded to this shape, we just need a shape with 0 as the lower bound. 
- We don’t want really long run-times … so check a Bout where R0 is really, really big (see bfin output file, see ltstp)

- drought atlas in Europe — are megadroughts less common?
