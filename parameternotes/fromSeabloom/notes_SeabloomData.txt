Notes on Eric Seabloom’s data that she shared for storage effect modeling

** Current status as of 8 Jan 2017 (see notes below): **
** I have calculated what we can but am waiting on some info from Eric to move my calculations out of Seabloom2003_data tab in parameters.xlsx to params tab (same file) **

Dat received on 8 November 2016. Here’s Janneke’s email:

I am still alive!Sorry to be dreadful in getting you some seed data, but I have been super hectic and Ihaven't worked with these data much so they were a bit messy to assemble. In addition, allthe work I had done about 12 years ago was in SAS, so I had some nostalgic times lookingback at SAS code trying to figure out what I had done!Anyway, I hope this will still be useful.These data are from three experiments (Fire, Water, and Nitrogen) conducted in a grasslandat Sedgwick Reserve near Santa Ynez, CA. The details are in the attached paper (Seabloomet al. 2003. PNAS).Each experiment shares a core set of two treatments.1. Starting plant community (Annual or Perennial Grass Dominated)2. Reciprocal Seeding (Annual seed added to perennial community and perennial seed addedto the annual community).The experiment then differ in other treatments:- Fire Experiment (Control or Burned Prior to Seeding)- Nitrogen Experiment (Control or Nitrogen Addition)- Water Experiment (Control, Watering, Gopher Exclusion, Watering and Gopher Exclusion).I am attaching the seed data on the three annual grasses we tracked first (Hordeummurinum, Bromus hordeceus, Bromus madritensis). I will tackle the three perennial grassesnext (Nassella pulchra, Elymus glaucus, Bromus carinatus). The annuals are a bit easier,as we just collected whole plants. For perennials, we could not really isolate individualsvery well, so we have seed data on a per area basis.Seed data are from annual grass individuals collected in each plot in each of 3 years.From these plants I could calculate seed mass per plant, number of seeds per plant, massof a seed, seed mass to vegetative mass ratio etc. If there are other things you want, Imight be able to extract them.Abundance data is based on biomass samples sorted to species for 5 years of treatments. Iadded up the number of samples for the clipping and sorting, and it would equal a strip ofbiomass 10 cm wide and 1.3 km long. Geez.... this was a big project!Here is a list of the attached files:invade-exp-file-descriptions.xlsx - List of the variables in each file.invade-exp-data-output-annual-seeds.csv - Annual seed data fileinvade-exp-data-output-full-plant-biomass.csv - Biomass data sorted to speciesinvade-exp-data-output-taxa-table-biomass.csv - Lookup table for some basic information oneach of the taxa
invade-exp-ann-seed-analysis.R - This file reads in the annual seed data and does somequick plots and analyses to give you a feel for the data.I am trying to get this well documented enough to submit to Dryad, but I hope this isworkable. I know it is a bit clunky now. If it is interesting for you but confusing, wecould have a Skype call.OK... I am going to open a bottle of wine and pray that the electorate at large is atleast somewhat sane!Sorry again for being dreadful. Now that I have blown off the dust from these data, Ithink I can get you the perennial grass seed data reasonably quickly.Best!Eric

Update as of 8 January 2017

I emailed Eric the following queries today:

(1) Is plntmass (defined as ‘Mean mass of a single plant (g)’) vegetative only? That is, if I want to calculate total plant mass should I add together plntmass and sdms.plt (defined as ‘mean mass of seeds per plant (g)’)?

(2) Is plntmass above and belowground or just aboveground?

(3) Is plntmass really in grams? I ask because I am trying to estimate seeds produced per gram (ideally end of season) biomass and if I divide sds.plt (‘Mean number of seeds per plant’) by plntmass I get numbers in the hundreds. Plus plants of generally less than 1 g seem small to me, even for a scraggly annual. 

More notes by me:

Data we have:
- seed mass (per individual plant)
- plant mass (per individual plant)
- mass of one seed
- seeds per individual plant

So I think we can calculate the following for annuals (we don’t yet have the perennial data and note that if we did have it it would be on an area basis — see Eric’s email above):
- B_i (biomass per individual) 
- phi_i (but without overwintering) … biomass to seed number conversion
- b_0 (per seed biomass)
- and we have m_i from Everard (just annual vs. perennial) already

In the R code from invade-exp-ann-seed-analysis.R I calculated the above for just the UNSEEDED plots but across treatments and year. I included the mean, min and max of these values in the parameters.xlsx file.
