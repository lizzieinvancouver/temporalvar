<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

(1) Work for PhenologyModelConceptual.R
- Draw schematic (or code) and send it to Lizzie for alternative conceptfig_tau.jpg
- Add code for one year g curves.

(2) We need to fill in XX here:
We examined [how decreasing R0 with earlier start of season] by again shifting the mean start of season XX earlier over XX years at the same time that we shifted the size of the resource pulse lower (XX over 500 years).

(3) Any thoughts on what to put in [insert more understanding here.] below?

Persistence of two-species communities via both stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms occurred more often in communities where species traded off competitive traits ($R^*$) with tracking ($\alpha$). While again, the non-stationary environment favored higher trackers, who in turn drove the extinction of species with lower tracking values from many two-species communities, some two-species communities persisted (223 out of 1467 two-species communities persisting after end of stationary, or 15.2\%). These communities included equalized species, as well as [insert more understanding here.] Taken together, this simple simulations show how non-stationarity can drive local species extinction and reshape the underlying assembly mechanisms of communities.

Think on ... lots of studies link early to tracking -- this could highlight a fundamental trade-off that early things track (and do everything quick) while later things bet-hedge more and invest longer .... but could also be an artifact. (BOX)


<><><><><><><><><>><><><><><><><><><>
MUST DO items before friendly review:
(1*) Fix abstract (some text commented out and pasted below)
	(1a) NEED to review R code etc. with Kelley!
(*) Update the meta-analysis
(*) Fix the text in the box
(*) Adjust the climatedata figure and make sure it's referenced in the correct places (or just change where it's referenced??!)


Also do ...
(*) Add citations from Ben ... (see below)
(*) Say somewhere that static timings are not very common, and static distances between species are probably even less common, then cite Volker as an idiot -- \cite{volkerass}
(*) Review below notes and address/re-organize
(*) Add supp cross-reference (and work on supp)
(*) Read a few critical papers and get citations in
(*) Swing back around to spatial tracking at the end? Refs at the end of the ms for this, if we want. 


Refs to review and see if they should be added?
- Phillimore paper (photoperiod x temperature)
- Iler on detrending (maybe?)
- Get some data on the SOS changing: SOS paper from Ault group?... Here's that paper: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-016-3313-2 Which suggests 2.6 days/decade average in future, see also Fig 16. And from Conclusions "While natural climate variability has been the dominant control on spring onset in the past, our results argue that this could change considerably by mid-century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to go unchecked." 
- Read Volker paper
- Read Zettlemoyer (2019 ELE)
- Any Gothic papers to add to 'Interspecific variation in tracking' ... They probably show intersting variation


Lower priority to do ...
(-) Can always check outline again for anything we missed.... 
(-) Add another example (Thackery lake and/or Lake Washington story-line or see  https://www.pacificclimate.org/data (see also: http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/climate-change/snow.html or https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/UCLA-CCS-Climate-Change-Sierra-Nevada.pdf)) to: Understanding non-stationarity in ecological systems requires first identifying what has shifted in the underlying distribution that produces variation in the transition from stationary to non-stationary, and what remains constant. For example, with climate change, warming has increased mean temperatures over time, with minimum temperatures generally increasing more than maximum—this results in an underlying distribution for daily temperature where the mean is increasing through time and the variance is decreasing (Stocker et al., 2013; Screen, 2014), despite a growing literature on increasing variance in temperature (e.g., Vasseur et al., 2014).


FIGURES (we have these, see temporalvar/R/graphs/modelruns/histograms and I don't think they work super well):
- $\tau_{i}$ vs. R* trade-off and histogram of persisting $\tau_i$ under stat/nonstat $\tau_{P}$ environment
- alpha vs.$\tau_i$ trade-off and histogram of persisting alpha under stat/nonstat $\tau_{P}$ environment
- alpha vs. R* trade-off and histogram of persisting alpha under stat/nonstat $\tau_{P}$ environment

Ben Cook notes (9 September 2019)
- Refs/examples: Different decades have different climate regimes
	- https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.3400
	- https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/2011JCLI4069.1 (1/3 of long-term trend is associated with natural variability)

- Refs/examples: Relatedly, estimates of long-term change using simple linear regression are influenced by the climate at the start of the time-series (with greater changes seen from time-series that started in unusually cold decades, such as the 1950s for much of North America).
	- "That's just basic statistics though."
	- 50s was cool compared to 30s GISS temp record in US perhaps see US here: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v4/

- Refs for "The shape of this underlying distribution varies across systems and in how it is measured—the total amount of rainfall in semi-arid systems is often highly skewed compared to the more normal distribution of the thermal sum of many temperate growing seasons."
	- Daily precip is binomial 
	- Or break down and calculate it myself ...

Note: for simulations where R0 declines during the ns period.  It will decline from mu to mu*R0ns where nsR0 is the value of the nsR0 flag in getInputParms.txt.  The third (stationary) period, if it exists, takes the final value of R0

- Where to send? GCB/Journal of Ecology or frame as a concept paper!?
	-> Megan suggested Ecosphere!
